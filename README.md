I made this ATM Interface with which you can create your own bank account and check your Withdrawals,Deposits,Transfers, as well as your Transaction history!

**Your user ID will be displayed on top of the screen and your PIN will be always 1234(You can change it whenever you like).**

### DEPOSIT

**As you can see i chose the 3rd option, which is Deposit. Then i chose the account i wanted to deposit the money,the amount, and finally, the memo.**
